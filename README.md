# DSA-Sudoku-Solver
These are a suite of C++ programs which deal with Sudoku Puzzles. The name might be misleading, yes, but these programs don't just solve Sudoku puzzles, they also achieve other objectives such as Sudoku Puzzle Validation.

# Sudoku-Solver
This is a program which solves 9x9 Sudoku puzzles. Written completely in C++ and built wholly from scratch, this program reads input either from a user or from a file containing the Sudoku values and solves the puzzle. It employs concepts such as backtracking and recursion.

The user can either input the values manually one-by-one when the program is running.

The user can write all the values into a file, seperated by whitespaces. The file can have any name or extension. When the program is running, the user will be prompted to simply enter the name of the file (with extension).
